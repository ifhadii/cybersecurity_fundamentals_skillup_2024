# Key Elements of Cybersecurity

## Introduction

In cybersecurity, securing information assets involves focusing on three key elements: People, Process, and Technology. These elements collectively form the foundation for effective cybersecurity strategies.

### Example: Protecting an Expensive Painting

Imagine protecting an expensive painting:
- **Security Guards**: Direct physical protection.
- **Monetary Deposits/Insurance**: Mitigate risk for visitors.
- **Laser Trip Wires, Cameras, Sensors**: Technological surveillance.

Each option has advantages and disadvantages, emphasizing the need for a multi-layered approach in cybersecurity.

## People

People are critical in cybersecurity despite its digital nature:
- **End Users**: Directly interact with digital systems.
- **System Designers**: Responsible for system architecture.
- **Human Factor**: Leading cause of cybersecurity incidents.
- **Example**: Alert fatigue demonstrates the importance of designing systems with human behavior in mind.

## Process

Processes in cybersecurity:
- **Defined Steps**: Business activities structured for efficiency.
- **Impact on Security**: Processes can enhance or hinder cybersecurity efforts.
- **Attributes of Good Processes**: Clear, accessible, and consistent.
- **Example**: Simplified processes reduce user frustration and improve compliance.

## Technology

Technological infrastructure in cybersecurity:
- **Encompasses**: Device encryption, network defenses, anti-malware technologies.
- **Purpose**: Solve problems without creating user inconvenience.
- **Example**: Automated patch management ensures software updates, balancing security and usability.

### Table: Technological Leaps in Security

| Technological Leap         | Business Benefit               | Perceived Drawback             | User Responses                   |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Automated Patch Management | Ensures all software updates   | Interruptions in device use     | Users avoid shutting down devices|
| High Complexity Passwords  | Increases password security    | Tedious to use                 | Use of predictable passwords    |
| Password Expiry Policies   | Limits compromise duration    | Predictably repetitive         | Sequential password changes     |
| Encrypted Emails           | Secures email communication   | Additional complexity          | Potential feature disabling    |

## Application of Cybersecurity Elements

### Online Bank Account

- **People**: Customers, bank employees (customer service, IT support).
- **Process**: Account management, transactions, customer support.
- **Technology**: Secure website/app, encryption, authentication methods.

### Personal Laptop

- **People**: Owner/user, potentially family or colleagues.
- **Process**: Personal/professional tasks, entertainment, communication.
- **Technology**: Operating system, software applications, hardware components.
