## Information Security

### Understanding Cybersecurity vs. Information Security

Cybersecurity focuses on protecting digital systems, while information security emphasizes safeguarding valuable information regardless of the method of attack.

### CIA Triad: Objectives of Information Security

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring information is private and accessible only to authorized entities.
- **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of information and preventing unauthorized modifications.
- **Availability**: Ensuring information is accessible and usable when needed.

### Importance of Prioritization

Different organizations prioritize CIA objectives differently based on their specific needs and assets.

### Personal Asset Evaluation

- Assessing the impact of losing Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability on personal assets such as bank accounts, photos, social media, and mobile phones.
- Using a rating scale (1-5) to evaluate consequences, helping prioritize security measures.

### Conclusion

Understanding these fundamentals equips individuals to grasp cybersecurity principles and prioritize protections effectively in both personal and organizational contexts.
